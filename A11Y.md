Things we did to improve accessibility:
- added descriptive aria tags to provide greater semantic meaning of the state of components (e.g. aria-expanded is used in the navbar accordian component indicate whether option is open or closed)
- added aria-described tags to describe the type of data an input is expecting.
- added aria-labels to elements without explicit labels a way to determine the data.
- provided alt tags to all image components to describe the semantic importance of it on the page. For example, for all listing thumbnails we provided an alt tag stating the image was a listing thumbnail.
- maintained a high colour contrast between text and background so users can properly view the content. For example, our view more photos button is located directly over the listing thumbnail but to ensure the text is readable, we added a white background such that it is not affected by the listing thumbnail image.
- making all pages on the website responsive arguably improved our accessibily by providing a less adrupt and clunky user experience.
